<p>
	<strong>Uses of Cobblestone:</strong></p>
<p>
	Cobblestoned and setted streets gradually gave way to macadam roads, and later to tarmac, and finally to asphalt at the beginning of the 20th century. However, cobble&shy;stones are often retained in historic areas, even for streets with modern vehicular traffic. Many older villages and cities in Europe are still paved with cobblestones. In recent decades, cobblestones have become a popular material for paving newly pedestrianised streets in Europe. In this case, the noisy nature of the surface is an advantage as pedestrians can hear approaching vehicles.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cobblestone Crusher:</strong></p>
<p>
	High-efficiency cobble stone Crusher: This machine adopts the proper broken cavity shape and broken principle of lamination , produces broken effect among particles,thereby increases the cube proportion of finished product obviously, decreases the needle schistose cobblestone, and the grade is more homogeneous.</p>
<p>

<p>
	<strong>Pebble Basics</strong></p>
<p>
	A pebble is a clast of rock with a particle size of 4 to 64 millimetres based on the Krumbein phi scale of sedimentology. Pebbles are generally considered to be larger than granules (2 to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than cobbles (64 to 256 millimetres diameter). A rock made predominantly of pebbles is termed a conglomerate. Pebble tools are among the earliest known man-made artifacts, dating from the Palaeolithic period of human history. Cobblestones are stones that were frequently used in the pavement of early streets.</p>
<p>
	Cobblestones are typically either set in sand or similar material, or are bound together with mortar. Paving with cobblestones allows a road to be heavily used all year long. It prevents the buildup of ruts often found in dirt roads. It has the additional beneficial advantage of not getting muddy in wet weather or dusty in dry weather. A disadvantage is that carriage wheels, horse hooves and even modern automobiles make a lot of noise when rolling over cobblestone paving. In England, the custom was to strew the cobbles outside the house of a sick or dying person with straw, so as to dampen the sound.</p>
